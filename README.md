# express_crud_api
CRUD API with Node, MongoDB, and Express

Note: 
The following Express CRUD API is the framework to work with TVMaze.com API JSON data input.
Future updates to this will provide the direct interfacing between both, while the API here
stores data to a MongoDB database. Although redundant, it is a good excercise on creating
backup databases from API transfers and to add data from other resources that can be 
protected by authentication
